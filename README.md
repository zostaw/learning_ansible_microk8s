# Initiate microk8s cluster

This project is my learning field for ansible and k8s.
I'm using CentOS VMs installed in my home-network to form a cluster.

## Prerequisites

1. ansible [core 2.13.5]+
2. unix-based servers
3. single login with ssh-key connection to all of the servers

## Usage

1. Edit hosts.yaml - place your k8s servers IPs
